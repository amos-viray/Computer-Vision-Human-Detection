# Computer-Vision-Human-Detection
Human detection system using the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.  The project was divided into four phases: data collection, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and an ablation study exploring the effects of different HOG parameters.
